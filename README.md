Speed typing test websites are useful for people who want to learn to type faster, type without looking at their keyboards, practice typing specific sets of entries (think numeric tests, address test, emoji test?), or get used to a new keyboard. You will also learn how to load different data sources based on the user input, store state in the browser, and create a timer.
